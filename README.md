# Voice-Identification
Compares voice fingerprints to be used in voice identification using google's gMusic.

# Installation
Pull the project and compile it using Maven. You can change the directory of the initial music/voice fingerprint in the codes and add the initial voice manually in the files. Then, run the project and test out the Voice Identification % by recording a new fingerprint.

# Notice
As stated previously, this relies on google's gMusic algorithm; some false positives might occur whilst using the application due to the API. I will be switching over to Elon Musk's OpenAI when it's fully released to the public and utilize Machine Learning for fingerprint identifications. Have fun <3
